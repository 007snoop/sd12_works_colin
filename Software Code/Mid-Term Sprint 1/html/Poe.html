    <h1>Quotes of Edgar Allen Poe</h1>
    <div class="center">
      <p>
        This maiden she lived with no other thought,<br />
        Than to love and be loved by me.<br />
        <br />
        I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as the Rhythmical Creation
        of Beauty.<br />
        Its sole arbiter is Taste.<br />
        <br />
        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dreamed before.<br />
        <br />
        The skies they were ashen and sober;<br />
        The leaves they were crisped and sere - The leaves they were withering
        and sere;<br />
        It was night in the lonesome October,<br />
        Of my most immemorial year.
